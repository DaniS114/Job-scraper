MOSY SMART POLICING PLATFORM
About the product
MOSY is an, integrated, modular information and communications technology platform that
increases the responsiveness, efficiency and effectiveness of mobile police officers. It is a product
in public safety and is currently used by police forces in Slovakia, Czechia and Moldova.
This easy-to-operate, multi-language capable platform can be adapted and tailored to meet any
police force’s requirements. MOSY works on Windows, Unix, Android and iOS, and on all screen
sizes, and it can be rapidly and securely integrated with other devices and systems.
MOSY:
• gives mobile police units all the operational and information tools they need, on one
compact platform, to fight crime and enforce the law
• facilitates real-time interaction, efficient coordination and rapid information exchanges
between police units and command centres
• saves police time by automating, streamlining and accelerating routine processes
Detailed technical architecture of MOSY is included in a separate presentation, but the main
technologies are:
NodeJS
, PostgreSQL, html, css, http REST, Websockets, Elastic search,
WebPack, NWJS, Capacitor. MOSY is built using a messaging-based approach, it’s a typical clientserver
architecture with a workflow engine built-in. It is one unified codebase for 4 types of
devices and 5 operating systems.
About the Role
• Location: Bratislava / Remote Hybrid
• Seniority: Senior (7+ years)
• Type: Full-Time
We are looking for a technically minded product leader to take over long-term ownership of MOSY,
a Node.js-based platform used in patrol vehicles as part of our smart policing solution. You will
serve as the guardian of the codebase, the owner of the architecture, and the internal voice of the
product — ensuring that MOSY remains maintainable, scalable, and aligned with both client needs
and long-term vision.
This is not a traditional product manager role. You will be expected to be technical, able to read
and write Node.js code, and manage integration work at the code and architectural level. At the
same time, you will operate as a bridge between business and development, translating police or
integrator requests into sustainable, maintainable features without fragmenting the platform.
In this role you will own a nationally deployed product with a real-world impact on public safety.
You will work with autonomy and authority to define technical direction and roadmap, suffer from
minimal bureaucracy, work in a high-trust environment and benefit from flexible work with small
team that has large impact.
Key Responsibilities
Product Ownership
• Maintain a clear roadmap for the MOSY platform.
• Track global trends and competitors in mobile policing platforms.
• Translate customer change requests into long-term product features.
• Own the product backlog, prioritizing sustainable feature evolution.
Technical Leadership
• Own the technical architecture and ensure the product does not fragment across
deployments.
• Define and enforce standards for integrations, extensions, and partner implementations.
• Serve as senior developer when needed (code reviews, debugging, spike development).
• Own release management, CI/CD pipeline governance, and codebase integrity.
Integration & Support Oversight
• Coordinate integration work with external teams (e.g., Slovak Police IT).
• Ensure customer-specific changes are developed as modules/plugins, not forks.
• Manage hotfixes, maintenance releases, and version control across environments.
• Act as point-of-contact for escalated technical issues and major incidents.
Developer Coordination
• Serve as team lead for the small support squad (2–3 developers initially).
• Manage relationships with key contributors, ensuring stable collaboration.
