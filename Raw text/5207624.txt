Information about the position
Job description, responsibilities and duties
Brightpick is revolutionizing warehouse automation with cutting-edge robotic solutions and intelligent systems that power some of the world’s most advanced fulfillment centers. We design and deliver technology that helps customers achieve operational excellence with speed, precision, and reliability. We are looking for a creative and hands-on Electronics & Embedded Systems Engineer to join our Mechatronics team. You will work alongside smart colleagues to design the "brain and nervous system" of our Autonomous Mobile Robots and complex automation machinery.
The Role As an Electronics & Embedded Systems Engineer, you will bridge the gap between mechanical hardware and intelligent software. Your primary goal is to design, prototype, and implement electronic components and integrated circuits that drive our automation solutions. You will handle the full spectrum of electronics engineering—from designing circuits and building rough "proof-of-concept" prototypes to developing low-level embedded software and finalizing instructions for mass production. This role requires a deep understanding of servo drives, sensors, and the communication protocols that make industrial automation tick.

Brief description of the company
The journey of our company started in 2013 when 4 friends came up with the idea to provide eyes for robots worldwide so that they could see and understand it. This idea led to a series of patents and awards. Shortly thereafter, the four-man company grew fast, becoming a technological sanctuary for machine vision, smart automation enthusiasts & innovators.
In 2021 Photoneo launched its new Business Unit BRIGHTPICK, the first fully automated fulfillment solution for warehouses and grocers and added to its broad competences and industries served. In early 2025 the sensor/3D vision part of the company (‘’Photoneo’’) was acquired by Zebra Technologies, marking a significant and celebrated tech acquisition in Slovak history.
We, the remaining part of the company, were rebranded as Brightpick, with hubs in the USA and EU (with main HQ in Slovakia), dedicated to providing global automation solutions for e-commerce and grocery fulfillment.
Being a part of Brightpick means being a part of a team that continuously pushes the boundaries further and creates space for solutions of the future. Join us and experience the journey with us!
