Digital Product Manager – Intelligent Learning Experiences
Place of work
Moldavská cesta, Košice, Slovakia (Job with occasional home office)
Contract type
full-time
Wage (gross)
From 2 200 EUR/month
Final salary is negotiable.
We are offering base salary depending on seniority level and previous experience of candidate. In addition to base salary we provide variable part and other financial benefits.
We’re reinventing how people grow at work — using AI, data, and design to turn learning into an adaptive, everyday experience. As Product Manager for Intelligent Learning Experiences, you’ll build the next generation of digital learning products that reach 50,000+ employees a year — experiences that feel more like Spotify or Duolingo than traditional corporate training. You’ll combine product strategy, systems thinking, and applied AI to build tools and journeys that accelerate performance, engagement, and skill growth — all embedded into the flow of work and powered by our enterprise LLM assistant.
What will you do?
Own the product vision and roadmap for digital and hybrid learning experiences — from discovery to launch and iteration.
Translate business capability needs into digital products that deliver measurable outcomes.
Lead product discovery with users, business units, and tech teams — uncover real performance and learning needs.
Design and deliver AI-powered features like personalized learning paths, virtual coaches, and smart simulations.
Partner with data and analytics teams to measure impact and ROI on engagement, skill development, and productivity.
Work with engineers and designers to embed learning into core digital platforms (Teams, intranet, corporate LLM).
Manage the product backlog, define success metrics, and run agile sprints with internal and external partners.
You will succeed if you:
5+ years’ experience in product management or digital product design — ideally in SaaS, edtech, or digital experience products.
Deep understanding of user experience, journey design, and data-driven iteration.
Comfort working with AI technologies, APIs, or conversational interfaces.
Systems thinker — you see how multiple digital touchpoints connect to create continuous experiences.
Comfortable translating complexity into simple, intuitive digital flows.
Data-literate — you use analytics to inform decisions and prove business impact.
Curious about human learning and performance, but not constrained by traditional L&D models.
Entrepreneurial — you build, test, learn, and iterate fast.
Nice to have:
Background in edtech, behavior change, or human-centered AI.
Familiarity with LLMs, adaptive learning, or simulation-based experiences.
Experience working with design systems or personalization engines.
Technical literacy in APIs, no-code tools, or prototyping platforms.
