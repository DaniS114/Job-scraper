Brief description of the company
The journey of our company started in 2013 when 4 friends came up with the idea to provide eyes for robots worldwide so that they could see and understand it. This idea led to a series of patents and awards. Shortly thereafter, the four-man company grew into a 200+ people technological sanctuary for machine vision and smart automation enthusiasts & innovators.
The company has offices in the USA and Slovakia, from where we  deliver machine vision technology and robotic intelligence software to almost every country in the world. Today, Brightpick helps companies improve the performance and efficiency of countless applications in manufacturing, fulfillment, and assembly, including bin picking and pick & place tasks, robot guidance, machine tending, inspection & quality control, or 3D model creation.
In 2021 Photoneo launched its new Business Unit BRIGHTPICK, the first fully automated fulfillment solution for warehouses and grocers and added to its broad competences and industries served. In early 2025 the sensor/3D vision part of the company (‘’Photoneo’’) was acquired by Zebra Technologies. We got renamed to Brightpick and started to offer a warehouse automation solution for ecommerce and grocery fulfillment. Being a part of Brightpick means being a part of a team that continuously pushes the boundaries further and creates space for solutions of the future. Join us and experience the journey with us!
