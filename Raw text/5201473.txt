Information about the position
Job description, responsibilities and duties
We are seeking an Application Support Engineer with prior experience in an application support role to join our team and help ensure the stability, efficiency, and continuous improvement of our production environment. In this role, you will take ownership of resolving complex production incidents, identifying root causes, and collaborating with multiple teams to enhance the performance and reliability of our systems. You will be instrumental in supporting our loan handling software and related applications, which serve customers across 10+ countries, while driving operational excellence and delivering exceptional user experiences.
This role is perfect for someone who enjoys problem-solving, thrives in a collaborative environment, and has a strong technical foundation—particularly in Microservices, APIs, SQL and analyzing and troubleshooting logs using tools like Kibana. Familiarity with RabbitMQ and Kafka is beneficial, and while our applications are primarily cloud-based (e.g., on Azure), deep knowledge of the hosting platform is not essential.
Key Responsibilities
Analyze, troubleshoot, and resolve complex business process incidents related to technical and process issues.
Take ownership of critical production incidents, coordinating effectively with Business, Backoffice, and Development teams.
Set up and optimize application and process monitoring using appropriate tools to proactively prevent production issues.
Lead root cause analyses and contribute to the problem management process to enhance system stability.
Troubleshoot technical issues, assign priorities, and escalate problems where necessary.
Create and maintain comprehensive documentation for business processes and system workflows.
Actively participate in projects, business analysis, development lifecycle processes, and testing of hotfixes.
Monitor post-deployment activities to ensure production environment stability.
Mentor and provide training to junior team members.
