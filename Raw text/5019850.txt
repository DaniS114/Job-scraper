Your role
Are you an experienced Full Stack Developer with a passion for modern technologies and a talent for mentoring others? We’re looking for a Senior Developer with strong expertise in Java and React.js to help guide our team through an exciting digital transformation journey.
In this role, you’ll collaborate with a diverse group of professionals—many of whom come from an SAP background—as we embrace a full-stack development approach and build a brand-new component from the ground up.
You'll be working closely with an English-speaking technical architect who will provide strategic direction, while you take on a key leadership role within the team—driving technical excellence, sharing best practices, and supporting the team’s growth.
This is more than a coding role. It's a chance to:
•	Make a meaningful impact by shaping how full-stack development is adopted across the team.
•	Mentor and empower others, fostering a collaborative and knowledge-sharing environment.
•	Lead by example, working hands-on with the latest technologies in a greenfield project.
If you're someone who enjoys building, teaching, and inspiring others—while working in a supportive and forward-thinking team—we’d love to meet you.
Key Responsibilities
•                  Guide the technical development of a new component using Java and React.
•                  Coach and upskill the current SAP-oriented team in modern full stack practices.
•                  Facilitate learning and knowledge-sharing within the team.
•                  Contribute to design discussions, architectural decisions, and hands-on development.
•                  Promote code quality, best practices, and continuous improvement.

•                  Proven experience mentoring or technically guiding other developers.
•                  Clear passion for teaching and helping others grow.
•                  Solid understanding of RESTful APIs and relational databases (PostgreSQL, Oracle).
•                  Familiarity with tools such as Docker, Postman, Git, etc.
•                  Advanced English (spoken and written): able to communicate technical concepts fluently.
