The Role
We are looking for a strategically minded and insight-driven professional to join our Central Employee Survey Team. This role sits at the intersection of analytics, employee engagement, and organizational development — helping to shape how we listen to our employees, understand what drives engagement, and translate insights into impactful action.
You will work closely with data and analytics experts, bringing their technical outputs to life through meaningful stories, actionable measures, and senior-level presentations. Your work will directly inform board discussions and shape the future of our employee experience and listening strategy.
What will you do?
Employee Listening & Survey Management:
Support the design and continuous improvement of our global employee survey and pulse programs, ensuring alignment with business priorities and organizational culture.
Insight Translation & Storytelling:
Partner with the analytics team to interpret quantitative results, identify trends, and build clear, compelling narratives that guide leaders toward impactful actions.
Transform data and findings into engaging reports, visual summaries, and presentations for executive and board-level audiences.
Hypothesis Development & Collaboration:
Act as the bridge between People Analytics and HR leadership — formulating hypotheses, asking the right questions, and helping to shape analytical priorities and frameworks.
Engagement Program Development:
Drive the evolution of our engagement initiatives by translating insights into concrete actions and supporting the implementation of company-wide engagement measures.
Employee Listening Strategy:
Contribute to the future design of our global employee listening framework — including questionnaire design, new feedback formats, and emerging methodologies for continuous listening.
Stakeholder Management:
Partner closely with HR Business Partners, Organizational Development, and Communications to ensure survey insights are embedded in the business and drive measurable improvement.
You will succeed if you:
Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Organizational Psychology, HR, Business, Communications, or related field.
5+ years of experience in employee engagement, HR insights, or people strategy roles.
Proven track record of turning analytics into strategic narratives and leadership presentations: High data literacy — able to “speak the language” of analytics without needing to code.
Strong conceptual and strategic thinking: Experience developing or managing enterprise-wide engagement or employee listening programs.
Excellent storytelling and communication skills for executive audiences, confident presentation creator and experienced in visual storytelling.
Ability to influence and engage senior stakeholders.
