Brief description of the company
The journey of our company started in 2013 when 4 friends came up with the idea to provide eyes for robots worldwide so that they could see and understand it. This idea led to a series of patents and awards. Shortly thereafter, the four-man company grew fast, becoming a technological sanctuary for machine vision, smart automation enthusiasts & innovators.
In 2021 Photoneo launched its new Business Unit BRIGHTPICK, the first fully automated fulfillment solution for warehouses and grocers and added to its broad competences and industries served. In early 2025 the sensor/3D vision part of the company (‘’Photoneo’’) was acquired by Zebra Technologies, marking a significant and celebrated tech acquisition in Slovak history.
We, the remaining part of the company, were rebranded as Brightpick, with hubs in the USA and EU (with main HQ in Slovakia), dedicated to providing global automation solutions for e-commerce and grocery fulfillment.
Being a part of Brightpick means being a part of a team that continuously pushes the boundaries further and creates space for solutions of the future. Join us and experience the journey with us!
