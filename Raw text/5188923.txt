About the Role
We’re seeking a hands-on Senior Systems Engineer to join our Project Delivery Team. You will design, assemble, configure, document, and hand over turnkey infrastructures that we deliver to customers—covering Linux and Windows servers, end-user devices, Layer-2/Layer-3 switching, storage subsystems (NAS/SAN), and tape libraries. This is a field/implementation role (not internal IT) with occasional on-site work at customer locations and data centers.
Responsibilities
Solution design & build
Translate customer requirements and HLD/LLD into validated build plans and BoMs
Design and implement HA/clustered solutions (Pacemaker/Corosync, DRBD, Hyper-V failover clustering)
Size, configure, and tune storage platforms (RAID, ZFS, iSCSI/FC SAN, SMB/NFS NAS) and integrate tape libraries (LTO, SAS/FC, LTFS/backup apps)
Plan and configure enterprise switching: VLANs, trunking/port-channels, STP/RSTP, routing, ACLs, QoS
Deployment & integration
Rack/stack, cable management, firmware/driver baselines, and golden image preparation
OS installation and hardening (RHEL/Alma/Ubuntu, Windows Server), AD/DNS/DHCP integration, GPOs where relevant
Hyper-V host/cluster build, VM templates, networking (vSwitch), and storage presentation
Automation for repeatable builds (e.g., Bash/PowerShell, Ansible preferred) and runbooks
Operations readiness & handover
Produce full project documentation: LLDs, as-built, network/stencil diagrams, installation & admin manuals, SOPs, backup/restore guides
Conduct FAT/SAT, performance, and failover testing, and remediate findings
Deliver knowledge transfer to the internal support team
Quality, security & compliance
Apply OS and network hardening best practices, patch/firmware governance
Ensure delivery artifacts align with contractual, security, and regulatory requirements (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001 controls, GDPR data handling where applicable)
