Who we are
We’re a Slovak software company developing our own network automation and configuration management platform — Unimus. The entire product is built in-house, and currently deployed in over 3000 networks worldwide. Our software runs in production across a broad range of environments — from small business networks, through enterprise data centers, regional ISPs, to national-scale telcos and carriers.
Unimus automates backup, change tracking, configuration auditing, and other essential network operations tasks across over a million devices. Every support case we solve improves not just our customer’s infrastructure, but also the product itself.
We're not building software for someone else. We own the roadmap, the code, and the support. And we’re hiring someone to help us take our support to the next level.
What you’ll do
We’re looking for someone with a solid technical background who enjoys helping customers solve interesting challenges. This role involves working closely with our software and network technologies, and you’ll work with technical customers. You’ll take ownership of the entire support ticket lifecycle, from intake to resolution, including collaboration with developers when bugs or feature feedback come up.​
Solve technical support cases — involving routers, switches, the Linux and Windows ecosystems, or issues in our own software stack
Handle the support lifecycle end-to-end: ticket intake, triage, resolution, and follow-up with dev when necessary
Participate in troubleshooting calls and live chat with customers (typically network admins or sysadmins)
Ensure that the ticket queue flows, and nothing critical gets missed
Contribute to improving our internal tools, workflows, and documentation — and help make our support even smoother
Provide clear, courteous responses to customers and actively work to find solutions, even if it requires additional communication or research
Focus on customer satisfaction: your goal is to resolve issues in a way that meets the customer’s needs
Work independently in support, with guidance from the team on highly technical issues
This role benefits from organization, and calm problem-solving — but also empathy and curiosity. Behind every ticket is a person who just wants their infrastructure to work.
Who you’ll be talking to
We don’t do end-user support. All our users are technical — network administrators, sysadmins, DevOps engineers, etc. You’ll talk to people who know their way around routers, Linux and shells, and appreciate working with someone who can speak their language.
What you should know already
You should have practical experience in either networking or Linux and Windows system administration, enough to troubleshoot and help customers effectively. Ideally, you've worked in environments where you’ve had to diagnose and resolve real-world issues across network infrastructure and operating systems.
​
Core knowledge:
​
Networking (Layer 2–4): configuring and managing routers, switches, VLANs, routing protocols
Linux: command-line utilities, service management, logging, troubleshooting, deployment, iptables
Bash, basic scripting, file permissions, system security
Web stack basics: Apache/Nginx, databases, firewalls
Nice to know:
Troubleshooting tools: tcpdump, Wireshark
Docker, Git, GitHub
PKI, Linux hardening, firewalling
If you don’t know every one of these tools, that’s fine — but you should be comfortable diving in and learning quickly. We're here to support your growth.
How we work
Core hours are 10:00–16:00. US timezone support (12:00–20:00) is shared within a team rotation, so you won’t cover it every week.
We don’t play titles. Everyone knows their role, and when something doesn’t work, we talk openly — informal but professional.
No support chatbots — just real engineers solving real problems.
The people who built the product sit right next to us — just turn around and get things solved without unnecessary writing, scrolling, or waiting.
What you won’t deal with
Support for non-technical users
Ignored issues — when something breaks, we fix it promptly
Being on call during your vacation (or being on call at all)
Unclear pay or avoiding conversations about your growth

- take time off to recharge without guilt
and on top of all that, you’ll have access to parking, too.
