•	Work in micro-teams within a 14-member delivery group collaborating closely with the client
•	Develop features in an Agile, DevOps-driven environment with senior developers and architects
•	Contribute to iterative prototyping to improve system performance and user experience
WHAT WE
EXPECT
•	You have foundational experience in Java, familiarity with Spring Boot, and basic knowledge of relational databases
•	You already have around 2 years of practical work experience with Java (and preferably also Spring Boot)
•	You have Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in IT or related fields
•	You’re comfortable working with Git and motivated to learn new tools and frameworks used in large-scale modernization
•	You’re eager to grow in a long-term transformation project (3–5 years) involving cloud migration and architectural upgrades
•	You communicate confidently in English (B2 level and above), thrive in a collaborative nearshore setup and are open to occasional short time travels to client side
