But truth be told, our real standout benefit is our culture. It’s something you’ve got to feel to believe, and we can’t wait for you to experience it firsthand!
Flexibility is a fundamental aspect of our approach: And if you’re not feeling the office vibes today, no problem!

3 sick days per year: Sometimes, you just need a day to recover under a blanket, binge-watching your favourite shows. You get three days a year to call in sick guilt-free, no explanations needed—just rest and feel better.
3 extra vacation days: Because everyone deserves a little extra time to unwind, recharge, or finally take that spontaneous trip you've been dreaming about. We’re giving you three bonus days of vacation on top of your regular holidays to do whatever makes you happiest.
Fully paid sick leave starting from day 11:If you are unable to work for more than a few days, you don't need to worry. Sick leave at the same amount as your full salary starts from the 11th day, ensuring you can focus on getting better without financial stress.

Shared parking space and electric scooters: Got a car? No worries about parking—there’s a free parking space waiting for you near the office.  Do you prefer a greener commute? We have electric scooters ready for you in the office, whether you want to enjoy a carefree ride to work or to lunch.
YDD (Your Development Day): Once a month, you get a whole day dedicated entirely to your personal and professional growth. No tasks, no deadlines, just you exploring whatever sparks your curiosity—whether that’s learning a new skill, diving into a book, or attending a workshop. It’s your day, so make it count!
Learning & Development Programs: We’re big believers in continuous learning. That’s why we provide access to top-notch learning platforms like Pluralsight, Udemy, and our very own Visma Tech learning zone. Whether you want to dive deep into a new skill or stay ahead of industry trends, you’ve got a wealth of resources at your fingertips .
Stay active and healthy with our support: Whether you love hitting the gym, playing tennis, or relaxing in the sauna, we've got you covered with a MultiSport card that we help cover the cost of.
The office and chill out zone is open 24/7: Whether you’re an early riser or a night owl, our doors are always open for you. But remember, balance is everything—don’t forget to catch some Z’s!
Social events, parties, game nights, tournaments, and more: Work hard, play hard!

Get ready for some friendly competition and lots of laughs with your colleagues.
