Project Specialist for LIMS Implementation (m/f/d)
Join our vision – become part of the viridiusLAB AG team!
viridiusLAB AG
is a dynamically growing group of testing, environmental, pharmaceutical, and calibration laboratories with more than 950 employees across Austria, Germany, Italy, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Our goal is to elevate the standard of laboratory services in Central Europe through innovation, digitalization, and sustainability.
We are currently looking for a motivated and responsible Project Specialist for the Implementation of a LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) who will support our laboratories to implement a modern, professional system for managing laboratory processes.
If you enjoy connecting technology with real-world practice, understand laboratory workflows, and want to help build the digital future of laboratories —  this is the position for you!
Your Profile:
Installation and configuration of our internally developed Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) according to the needs of the group’s organizations and individual users. (Most laboratories will transition from Excel to this professional solution, with a significant impact on efficiency.)
You are familiar with flowcharts and process diagrams, and you understand that switching from one system to another cannot be successful without a thorough understanding of the current processes and systems used in the laboratory.
Clear planning and defined responsibilities are essential — part of your role will be to create and update the LIMS implementation project plan in Jira (Atlassian).
Creating Jira tickets for our development team.
Collaborating with other IT professionals and the Head of IT to ensure systems are properly integrated and work together efficiently.
Troubleshooting software issues and providing technical support to end users (laboratory staff). Since you’ll be configuring LIMS yourself, you’ll know how to help colleagues with related issues.
Analyzing systems and identifying areas for improvement.
Auditing and validating data to ensure accuracy.
Testing and evaluating software functionality.
Creating and maintaining documentation related to software applications, as well as developing training materials and delivering training sessions for end users.
Supporting gap analysis by identifying missing features prior to implementation.
Assisting with project management tasks.
Occasional visits to the headquarters in Vienna, where the central LIMS team is located.
Travel to laboratories within Slovakia and the Czech Republic to perform audits, training, and ensure successful implementation.
Your Responsibilities:
University degree (Bachelor’s or Master’s) ideally in Chemistry, Biology, IT, or a related field
Knowledge of laboratory or business processes is an advantage
Experience with software applications, implementations, or technical support
Analytical thinking, independence, and attention to detail
Willingness to learn new things and a friendly, team-oriented approach
English language skills
Advanced knowledge of MS Excel, Word, and Outlook
Valid driving license (category B) and willingness to travel
​

What We Offer:

Work in modern, well-equipped      offices with a friendly atmosphere
International teambuilding      events and collaboration with colleagues across Europe
