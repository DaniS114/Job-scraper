Your role:
Are you an experienced Full Stack Developer with a passion for modern technologies and a talent for mentoring others? We’re looking for a Senior Developer with strong expertise in Java and React.js to help guide our team through an exciting digital transformation journey.
In this role, you’ll collaborate with a diverse group of professionals—many of whom come from an SAP background—as we embrace a full-stack development approach and build a brand-new component from the ground up.

Make a meaningful impact by shaping how full-stack development is adopted across the team.
Mentor and empower others, fostering a collaborative and knowledge-sharing environment.
Lead by example, working hands-on with the latest technologies in a greenfield project.
If you're someone who enjoys building, teaching, and inspiring others—while working in a supportive and forward-thinking team—we’d love to meet you.
Key Responsibilities:
Guide the technical development of a new component using Java and React.
Coach and upskill the current SAP-oriented team in modern full stack practices.
Facilitate learning and knowledge-sharing within the team.
Contribute to design discussions, architectural decisions, and hands-on development.
Promote code quality, best practices, and continuous improvement.
