About
the position
As Product Manager for Intelligent Learning Solutions, you’ll build the next generation of digital learning products that reach 50,000+ employees a year — experiences that feel more like Spotify or Duolingo than traditional corporate training. You’ll combine product strategy, systems thinking, and applied AI to build tools and journeys that accelerate performance, engagement, and skill growth — all embedded into the flow of work and powered by our enterprise LLM assistant.
Your key responsibilities:
Own the product vision and roadmap for digital and hybrid learning experiences — from discovery to launch and iteration.
Translate business capability needs into digital products that deliver measurable outcomes.
Lead product discovery with users, business units, and tech teams — uncover real performance and learning needs.
Design and deliver AI-powered features like personalized learning paths, virtual coaches, and smart simulations.
Partner with data and analytics teams to measure impact and ROI on engagement, skill development, and productivity.
Work with engineers and designers to embed learning into core digital platforms (Teams, intranet, corporate LLM).
Manage the product backlog, define success metrics, and run agile sprints with internal and external partners.
We work in a HYBRID STYLE of working.
The published salary is the minimum possible offer.
The starting salary may be higher depending on the extent of fulfillment of the employee's requirements (education, language skills, required practice, personality assumptions and skills).
