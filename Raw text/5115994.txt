Job description, responsibilities and duties
Are you a hands-on technical expert with a passion for building scalable data operations capabilities? We're looking for a technically-driven leader to architect, develop, and enhance common components on Swiss Re's strategic Palantir Foundry-based data platform. In this role, you'll apply your deep technical expertise in data engineering and software development to design robust solutions while guiding a team of engineers toward technical excellence.
About the Role
We are seeking a senior technical leader to drive development of future-oriented data operations capabilities, so called common components, on Swiss Re's strategic data and analytics management platform. As the Lead Engineer, you’ll collaborate closely with engineers, senior stakeholders, and domain experts across all Business Units and Group Functions.
Key Responsibilities:
- Product Ownership and Strategy
Define and drive the vision, roadmap, and lifecycle of common components—core services like load management, data quality management, metadata management - ensuring alignment with enterprise data strategy.
- Technical Leadership and Engineering Excellence
Contribute to the architecture, design, and development of common components, ensuring scalable, maintainable, and high quality solutions. Lead by example through hands-on engineering, including coding, testing, troubleshooting, and conducting code reviews. Foster best practices in software development and data engineering across teams.
- Operational Excellence
Oversee the reliable and scalable operation of common components, ensuring high availability, performance, and compliance with internal and external standards.
- Cross-Functional Collaboration
Partner with data architects, engineers, governance teams, and business stakeholders across all units to understand needs, gather feedback, and prioritize enhancements that benefit the further evolution of common components.
- Platform Enablement and Adoption
Promote the adoption of common components across the organization by delivering well-documented, user-friendly capabilities and providing enablement support (e.g., training, documentation, office hours).
- Innovation and Continuous Improvement
Stay ahead of industry trends and emerging technologies to evolve capabilities. Drive proof-of-concepts and pilot innovations that can be industrialized at scale.
- Governance and Risk Management
Ensure that common components support enterprise data governance policies, including data protection, access management, and auditability, while minimizing operational risks.

You will join the global Group Data Services (GDS) organization of the Chief Data and Analytics Officer. The organization consists of teams of enthusiastic data engineers, architects and platform specialists dedicated to realizing the full potential of Swiss Re's data. We engage with all parts of the company, enabling them to formulate and implement data ambitions, to develop group-wide data assets and to provide data-driven products and services to our clients. The platform you will work with is internally known as "Stargate"; a Palantir Foundry-based data platform that underpins a petabyte-scale data ecosystem of the Swiss Re group. The company uses it to perform a wide range of data processing tasks, building data integration solutions, advanced analytics and even state-of-the-art AI-based automated decision making.
