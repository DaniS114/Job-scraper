Information about the position
Job description, responsibilities and duties
Hey, let me tell you a bit about what it’s like to be a Product Owner here. Imagine stepping into a place where ideas turn into products, where collaboration fuels innovation, and where your voice truly shapes what comes next. That’s the environment we’re building — and we’re looking for a Product Owner who wants to be at the heart of it.
Product owner’s work
As a Product owner in our organisation, I step every day into a world where ideas turn into real products, where collaboration fuels innovation, and where my decisions help shape what we deliver next. As a Product Owner, I don’t just manage a backlog — I guide a vision. I translate needs, align priorities, and help my team focus on what will make the biggest impact. My mission is simple: Create clarity, deliver value, and help the team succeed.
What my days look like
My mornings often start by revisiting the product backlog. I refine user stories, adjust priorities, and make sure every item is clear, valuable, and actionable. Then I sync with the development team — together we align, discuss challenges, and keep momentum going. Sprint planning sessions are where I help the team understand why certain features matter. Backlog refinements are where I turn raw ideas into concrete stories. Reviews are moments where we celebrate progress and retrospectives are where we grow.
Throughout the day, I’m constantly moving between business conversations and technical discussions. I meet with stakeholders to explore their ideas or clarify expectations. I work with the Scrum Master to foster a healthy Agile rhythm. And I support the team by providing context, answering questions, and removing ambiguity so they can focus on building great things.
I lead through clarity, collaboration, and curiosity. I’m the voice of the product’s purpose — the person who explains not just what we build, but why. I help the team see the bigger picture; we stay aligned on priorities and encourage experimentation and continuous improvement. When tough decisions arise, I act as the steady hand. I make trade-offs, communicate transparently, and keep us driving toward meaningful outcomes.
My Connection to Technology
I’m not a developer, but I understand what it takes to build software well. I’m familiar with the software development lifecycle — from requirements analysis and design to coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance. This helps me empathize with the team and collaborate more effectively. Tools like Jira, Microsoft Teams and excel are part of my daily routine. Agile principles guide my decisions, and I’m committed to staying up-to-date with industry best practices. Certifications? They’re a bonus, but continuous learning is what really drives me.
Why This Role Matters to Me ?
I believe great products happen when vision, teamwork, and thoughtful execution come together. As a Product Owner, I get to be the bridge between what users need and what our team builds. I get to help shape solutions that matter. And I get to work with people who bring those solutions to life.
If this sounds like a journey, you’d want to be part of, then maybe our stories are about to connect.
Employee perks, benefits
My company supports me in improving my qualifications and knowledge through various voluntary courses and conferences.
I’m working mostly remotely, with regular weekly OFFICE DAYS  in our Košice office, where I get to meet my colleagues, enjoy great coffee and drinks, chill in our relax room and, after office hours, I meet my co- workers and enjoy our teambuildings.
We are a leading American company, but we don’t have to work US working hours.
My colleagues can usually reach me within our regular core hours - between 9 AM and 3 PM. We are working in flexible working time mode and I’m able to manage my working time. And most importantly! My overtimes are automatically compensated on a monthly basis.
In addition, let’s mention our office, a very cozy and informal space in the Košice city center.
Information about the selection process
CVs will be collected until 14 January 2026.  After that, we will do a review and then start planning the first rounds of interviews.

Brief description of the company
We are a tech company operating in the medical sector, mainly focused on the Vision industry. Our product has been active on the market for over 10 years and is used by over 1,500 practices across the United States.
Our platform provides patient insurance benefits details to doctors covering all major insurance providers in the US.
Why is this important? A large portion of vision practices in the United States is focused on Eyeglass sales in addition to optometric services. At the same time, it is common for employers to provide vision insurance as part of their employee benefits. This usually covers a purchase of one set of eyeglasses per year.
Since patients are usually not aware of all the details related to their vision benefits, it is more so important for doctors to have an easy-to-access and centralized place to get them for all major insurance providers.
Even though providing insurance information is our core functionality, there is much more our platform has to offer to optometry practices. We can integrate with their practice management systems to automate our workflows, provide prefilled patient forms, help setting up insurance plans, and best of all, carry out messaging campaigns focused on patients with unused insurance benefits.
ABB Optical Group in the United State is a leading provider of optical products, services and business solutions in the eye care industry. ABB operates through three business pillars: ABB Contact Lens, ABB Labs and ABB Business Solutions. ABB is focused on the future of eye care professionals, helping them succeed by making practices more efficient and assisting providers to effectively navigate market changes.
