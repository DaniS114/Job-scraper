Who we are
We’re a Slovak software company developing our own network automation and configuration management platform — Unimus. The entire product is built in-house, and currently deployed in over 3000 networks worldwide. Our software runs in production across a broad range of environments — from small business networks, through enterprise data centers, regional ISPs, to national-scale telcos and carriers.
Unimus automates backup, change tracking, configuration auditing, and other essential network operations tasks across over a million devices. Every support case we solve improves not just our customer’s infrastructure, but also the product itself.
We're not building software for someone else. We own the roadmap, the code, and the support. And we’re hiring someone to help us take our support to the next level.
What you’ll do
We're looking for a hands-on technical expert who’s also ready to lead. This role combines deep technical support work with team leadership. You’ll handle complex issues, work directly with technical customers, and lead a small team of experienced support engineers. You'll take ownership of the entire ticket lifecycle, from triage to resolution — including direct collaboration with developers on bugs, escalations, or feature feedback. You’ll also be responsible for improving our internal support processes, tooling, and overall support quality.
Lead and mentor a small team (currently 2 senior support engineers + you), while setting the standard for support quality and execution
Solve complex technical support cases — involving routers, switches, the Linux ecosystem, or issues in our own software stack
Handle the support lifecycle end-to-end: ticket intake, triage, resolution, and follow-up with dev when necessary
Jump on live troubleshooting calls with technical customers (typically network admins or sysadmins)
Own team priorities, ensure the ticket queue flows, and nothing critical gets missed
Work closely with sales on customer prioritization and reporting
Improve internal tooling, workflows, and documentation — and shape how our support works
This role requires structure, discipline, and a clear head — but also empathy and curiosity. Behind every ticket is a person who just wants their infrastructure to work.
Who you’ll be talking to
We don’t do end-user support. All our users are highly technical — network administrators, sysadmins, DevOps engineers, etc. You’ll talk to people who know their way around routers, Linux and shells, and expect the same from you.
What you should know already
You should have solid hands-on experience in both networking and Linux system administration — this role requires depth in both areas, not just familiarity. Ideally, you've worked in environments where you’ve had to diagnose and resolve real-world issues across network infrastructure and Linux systems.
Core knowledge:
Networking (Layer 2–4): configuring and managing routers, switches, VLANs, routing protocols
Linux: command-line utilities, service management, logging, troubleshooting, deployment, iptables
Bash, basic scripting, file permissions, system security
Web stack basics: Apache/Nginx, databases, firewalls
Nice to know:
Troubleshooting tools: tcpdump, Wireshark
Docker, Git, GitHub
PKI, Linux hardening, firewalling
If you don’t know every one of these tools, that’s fine — but you should be comfortable diving in and learning quickly. We're here to support your growth.
How we work
Core hours are 10:00–16:00. US timezone support (12:00–20:00) is shared within a team rotation, so you won’t cover it every week.
We don’t play titles. Everyone knows their role, and when something doesn’t work, we talk openly — informal but professional.
No support chatbots — just real engineers solving real problems
The people who built the product sit right next to us — just turn around and get things solved without unnecessary writing, scrolling, or waiting.
What you won’t deal with
Support for non-technical users — all our customers are experts
Ignored issues — when something breaks, we fix it promptly
