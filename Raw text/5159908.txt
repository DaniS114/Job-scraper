Job description, responsibilities and duties
Want to help shape the future of aviation safety? We're working on safety-critical applications in the Air Traffic Management (ATM) domain.
Voice communication is at the heart of aviation safety — it’s how pilots stay connected and guided through complex airspace. In critical moments, it's often the last reliable channel. That’s why we focus on delivering the very best in service quality, safety, and security. As ATM evolves, so do our tools.
Frequentis X10 is the first fully IT-based voice communication system in this space — built with modern, hyperscale data center tech and a revolutionary approach to flexibility and performance. Frequentis X10 is the optimal solution for all kinds of Air Traffic Control (ATC) operations, from low-traffic regional towers to high-end area control centres, including the new generation of ATC operations, such as regular and multi-remote towers, virtual centres and traffic management for uncrewed aircraft. The system permanently runs a duplicated parallel audio stream for every air/ground connection to guarantee uninterrupted audio.
If you wish to apply your experience and enthusiasm to the backend development of an innovative ATM audio and communication system then the X10 team is for you!
